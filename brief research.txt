1	Definition momentum and impulse

Momentum can be defined as "mass in motion." All objects have mass; so if an object is moving, then it has momentum - it has its mass in motion.
Momentum = mass • velocity
In physics, the symbol for the quantity momentum is the lower case p. Thus, the above equation can be rewritten as
p = m • v. we define momentum as mass times velocity and calculate the 
m is the mass and v is the velocity. 
of a moving object using p = mv. 

Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of an object. It is a force applied to an object for a certain length of time which will cause the objects momentum to change

Impulse = F • t

J= F • t

J = Impulse = N*m

F = unbalanced force = N

T = time = sec

Impulse = Change in momentum

2	Experiment1 momemtum

e.g 1, 2 cars with a different mass moving in the same direction, observe the velocity
A four-wheeler moving at a relatively fast velocity has a smaller momentum than the semi-truck because of its small mass and will stop much faster.

Experiment 2 Impulse

e.g.1 2 cars colliding with an object, observe the change in momemtum
A car is travelling at full speed. It crashes into the barrier, Here the huge force is applied on the wall by the car in a very little time interval which we term as an impulse
