-[button clicked] ->ball moves.
typewriter text plays
"this principle illustrates the definition of momentum which is mass in motion".
OR
"momentum is a property which applies to moving objects, it is mass in motion. If
something has mass and it is moving, it has momentum".
*[ball stops]

*****Transition from VRScene1 to VRScene2
Text appears to inform user can repeat the definition of momentum simulation or click
next to begin the experiment.
[make repeat button clickable], [next button flashing]

*****Experiment -VRScene2
*show navigation menu: definition, experiment, exit 
*show operators menu: play, repeat
*show results board

*we move the balls at the same time:
ballA[text label time] stops at 5 secs
ballB[text label time] stops at 10 secs

*****Results board
Show momentum for each ball after a certain time
??? text describing the results when experiment is complete
